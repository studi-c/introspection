# introspection
Compile time introspection in C++11 - The function has three different templates, according to the properties of the type

This is a toy example program, does not do anything useful, but it shows how to examine the type on which the template is invoked, and to provide one template for a type with one sort of member, another template if it has a different kind of member, and no template at all if it does not have anything useful.
